# PingPong-in-Lua
This is a basic Ping Pong game built using the language Lua and using the Love2D framework

In this game, there are two paddles(players) and one ball that is tossed around. The ball keeps moving and the players have to control the paddle to hit the ball and deflect it back.

The main aim of this project is become familiar with the language of Lua and explore a new domain of 2D game development
